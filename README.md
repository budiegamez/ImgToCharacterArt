ImgToCharacterArt is not an original idea but is one of  my very first successful scripts



The code is written is python so its kinda slow 



Steps to use:

1, Have Python

2, Open ur terminal

3, Locate to where u install the file

4, Adds a jpg file into the folder where the script is located(make name easy to make life easy)

5, Run script using terminal

6, Enter [file's name].jpg

7, It should poop out the results
